# Film-Budget-Revenue-Analysis

n this repository, we're going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. 

The question we want to answer today is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more?
